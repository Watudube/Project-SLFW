# Project Summary
At its largest scale, the Simulated Living Fantasy World (SLFW) game will simulate, a living fantasy world, where all NPC entities and players can mutually affect and interact one another. There would be a persistent sandbox and framework for NPCs to have their own motivations and objectives, and the game world itself simulates ecology and an economy. Economies and other systems will follow the principles of supply and demand, where there will be “no free lunch”. Consequently, player actions will have a direct effect on the state of the world and can shape it based on the established systems of that world. State changes in the game world will occur and be reflected to the player in real-time.
